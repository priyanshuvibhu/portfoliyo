    <pre> <h2>Emotion Detection Using Facial Expression Analysis</h2>
        Sep 2024- Oct 2024
        • Achieved 75% accuracy on the FER dataset by developing a deep learning model based on ResNet101, enabling
        real-time emotion recognition across 7 emotional states for versatile applications in emotion-aware systems.
        • Optimized model training by reducing total processing time by 30 hours through advanced data augmentation,
        transfer learning, and PyTorch-based fine-tuning techniques, resulting in a 25% improvement in training speed
        without compromising accuracy.
        • Engineered the model for scalable deployment in fields such as healthcare, customer support, and interactive AI
        applications, ensuring high performance and adaptability.
        <h2>Plant Disease Prediction</h2>
        Mar 2024- Apr 2024
        • Developed a machine learning model for plant disease diagnosis, analyzing over 38 classes to achieve an accuracy level of
        98.99%, improving diagnostic speed and precision in agricultural practices.
        • Trained on a diverse plant image dataset containing 90,000 images, focusing on efficient classification and providing
        actionable insights for farmers and agricultural experts.
        <h2>Smart Warehouse Management System</h2>
        Nov 2023- Jan 2024
        • Built an IoT-integrated warehouse management system with Blynk GUI for real-time monitoring of inventory,
        environmental conditions, and security, enabling immediate alerts, reducing the manpower to 100%.
        • Enhanced operational efficiency through tailored notifications, contributing to optimal inventory and environmental
        management in high-volume storage facilities.</pre>
